# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024, a series of daily programming challenges throughout December.

Go to advent of code to find out more: https://adventofcode.com/2024


## Structure

Each folder represents a day of the challenge:

day1/: Solution for Day 1

day2/: Solution for Day 2

And so on...


## Inside each folder, you'll find:

solution.<language>: My solution for the day's challenge.


## Languages Used

Solutions are implemented in JavaScript - unless I have changed my mind in a spurt of spontaneity. Check individual folders for details.


## Getting Started

### To run a solution:


Navigate to the specific day's folder.

Follow the instructions in the solution file (e.g., run node solution.js or python solution.py).

Feel free to fork this repository and try solving the challenges yourself!
